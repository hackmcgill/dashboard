          <h2>What is Discord?</h2>
          <p>
            Discord is a voice and text platform that allows people to interact
            in real time through audio and video channels. If you are familiar
            with Slack, then you can think of Discord as a more casual version!
            You can download both the desktop and mobile version of Discord by
            visiting{' '}
            <LinkDuo to="https://discord.com/download">
              <span>https://discord.com/download</span>
            </LinkDuo>{' '}
            or open Discord in your browser by visiting{' '}
            <LinkDuo to="https://discord.com/">
              <span>https://discord.com/.</span>
            </LinkDuo>
          </p>
          <h2>What is a discord server?</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              An invite-only home for the community - in our case, McHacks 10!
              If you are a slack user, you can think of it like a Slack
              workspace. It is a place where you can talk, ask for help, get
              announcements, hang out, and have fun!
            </li>
            <li>
              There will be a bunch of channels within the server for different
              purposes.
            </li>
            <li>
              The column on the very left-hand side of your Discord app is your
              server list. Any time you add a server, you'll see it pop up as a
              small circular icon in this list
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Pro Tip: </b>You can rearrange your server list by dragging
              server icons up and down
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h2>How do I make an account?</h2>
          <p>If you're on browser:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Visit{' '}
              <LinkDuo to="https://discord.com/">
                <span>https://discord.com/.</span>
              </LinkDuo>
            </li>
            <li>Create your username</li>
            <li>Complete the captcha</li>
            <li>A pop-up will appear; click Skip for now</li>
            <li>
              You will then get a notification, asking you to claim your
              account. Enter your email address and password, then click confirm
            </li>
            <li>
              Another pop-up will appear; if you wish to continue to stick with
              the browser version of discord, click skip
            </li>
            <li>
              You should receive a confirmation email within the next few
              minutes. Click the link and verify your Discord account
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>If you‚Äôre on desktop:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Click register, below login button</li>
            <li>
              Enter email, username, password, date of birth, then click
              continue
            </li>
            <li>
              You should receive a confirmation email within the next few
              minutes. Click the link and verify your Discord account
            </li>
          </ol>
          <h2>How do I join the McHacks 10 Discord server?</h2>
          <p>
            To join a server, click the "+" icon at the very bottom of the
            server list.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Select ‚ÄúJoin a Server‚Äù at the bottom of the pop-up and you will be
              asked for an ‚ÄúInvite Link‚Äù, which is provided in our week of email
            </li>
            <li>
              Paste the link and press ‚ÄúJoin Server‚Äù. And you are good to go!
            </li>
            <li>

            </li>
            <li>
              Please note that the invite links are case sensitive and could be
              expired. Also, a user cannot be a member of more than 100 servers,
              so you will need to leave one before you can join if you reach the
              limit
            </li>
            <li>
              If you are having trouble joining the server, please reach out to
              our team for assistance!

          <h2>What are text and video channels?</h2>
          <p>Each server is made up of voice channels and text channels.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>Text Channels</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  These are channels which are specifically made for talking
                  over text
                </li>
                <li>This creates an organized space for people to discuss</li>
                <li>
                  You can create channels for specific topics and add the
                  necessary members for each of the channels. (i.e you can have
                  one general channel, one front-end channel, one back-end
                  channel etc‚Ä¶)
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Voice Channels</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  These are where you can talk using your voice and video. You
                  also have the ability to share your screen
                </li>
                <li>
                  There is no join call button but rather you join the channel
                  by clicking on it
                </li>
                <li>
                  People on the server can see you are in a voice channel and
                  can also join
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>How to send messages or attachments:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              In text channels you will have a chat in the middle and you will
              be able to write text in there. The message is sent when you press
              enter
            </li>
            <li>
              If you want to go to a new line in the same message, you have to
              press ‚Äúctrl + enter‚Äù (windows) or ‚Äúcmd + enter‚Äù (mac)
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Attachments</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  On the chat bar on the left, there is a + button. You can
                  click on this and you will be able to send files that are on
                  your computer to the chat. Discord accepts file formats
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h2>How do I voice chat?</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              First you need to join a voice channel. Voice channels have the
              following logo ‚Äú
              <span role="img" aria-label="speaker">
                üîâ
              </span>
              ‚Äù
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>After this you will be able to start talking.</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  You might need to check your computer and audio settings to
                  make sure that you are not muted. You can verify this by
                  checking your voice settings in the settings part of discord
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Sharing video:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Once you join a voice channel, you will in the bottom left
                  corner a ‚ÄúVideo‚Äù option. If you click on it, it will activate
                  your video
                </li>
                <li>You might need to check your video settings</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Sharing screen:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Just next to the video options, you will see a ‚Äúscreen‚Äù
                  button. If you click on it, it will share your screen
                </li>
